# 👋 Hi, I’m Luca Williams

I'm a **Computer Science** and **Political Science** student at **Colgate University** passionate about building meaningful projects.

## 🧠 About Me
- 🔬 **Summer Researcher**: I'm currently working on a large-scale data project scraping over **22 million public comments** from [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/). We're building NLP pipelines using **OpenAI models** to analyze sentiment and affiliations of commenters. This project is part of my ongoing research with a political science professor, which I plan to continue into the academic year to potentially co-author a paper.
- 🛠 **Learning Full Stack Development**: In my spare time, I’m building a **meal prep web app** using **Node.js**, with plans to scale it and integrate more features for users with different goals—from college students to new chefs.
- 💡 **Interested in**: software development and civic technology. 

## 🚀 Projects & Interests
- 🍽️ Full stack software development
- ⌨️ Refurbishing a Apple II GS M0487 Keyboard to make it bluetooth and add other features based on [this repo](https://github.com/mattchesters/zmk-apple-desktop-bus-keyboard).
